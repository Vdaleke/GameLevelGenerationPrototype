# Level Generation Model

A level generation model for Unreal Engine 5 with a set of islands located in the same visible space for step-by-step progression. Level design tools are available to add your own islands (Level Instances), adjust spawn, number of islands, distance, location, etc.

Gameplay in a level begins when you interact with an actor. The transition between levels is performed through the teleport after completing the level. At the last level, a victory actor appears instead of a teleporter.
